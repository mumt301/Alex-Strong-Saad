        <h1>here is some information about me</h1>
        <p> my name is Alex Strong-Saad </p>
        <p> I study a few things! Music, Musical Applications of Technology and Feminist Studies </p>
        <p> I really love a lot of music.  I have studied classical, jazz, and a variety of popular styles on piano and guitar.  Having studied free jazz and its philosophies of moving beyond the limitations of eurocentrism and musical racism, I feel like all forms and traditions of music are valid and cool in their own right.</p>
        <p> also here is a picture of me and my neighbour who keeps breaking into my apartment</p>
